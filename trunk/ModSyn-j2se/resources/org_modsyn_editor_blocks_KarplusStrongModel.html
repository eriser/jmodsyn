<h3>{name}</h3>
Karplus-Strong synthesis is a simple form of physical modeling that is useful for simulating plucked strings and such.<br/>
A short burst of noise is created (to simulate the 'pluck'), which will resonate in a comb-filter with a strong feedback.<br/>
<br/>
Inputs:
<ul>
<li>frq: the frequency</li>
<li>trg: the trigger</li>
<li>fb: the feedback</li>
<li>cut: filter cut-off frequency (in Hz). Note that much filtering will lead to phase shifts, leading to an incorrect pitch.</li>
<li>plu: the time in seconds of the 'pluck'</li>
<li>env: the envelope of the pluck</li>
</ul>
Outputs:
<ul>
<li>OUT: the output</li>
</ul>
